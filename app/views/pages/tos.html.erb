<br />

<br />

If the disputing persons fail so to resolve the dispute within what CoinHost, in its sole judgment, deems to be a reasonable time, then CoinHost, at its option and without any obligation to do so, may, in accordance with and subject to the laws of the State of Utah, file an interpleader action in a court of competent jurisdiction within the State of Utah for the purpose of allowing the contending persons to resolve said dispute and to reach certainty regarding ownership of or rights in said site and/or account. The person or persons conclusively and finally determined by the interpleader action to be the rightful owner(s) or interest holder(s) of said site and/or associated account shall be obligated to reimburse CoinHost for all of its expenses relative to said interpleader action including without limit all its court costs and reasonable attorney fees.
